1) In this statement while i was working on one problem in PPO,
  
Code:
# Compute returns (used for value function loss)
returns = advantages + old_values.detach()

My question:  
is why is old_value.detatch() there, why is gradient not computed with old_values?

Behavior expected: 
The first thing the BOT needs to do is to understand what is that fundamental knowledge which the user doesn't know.
Then target to answer precisely.

Behavior observed: 
But the chatgpt gave me so many explanations and then finally gave the answer which i was expecting that, 

Here, returns depends on old_values, and old_values comes from old_policy, which is a neural network.

If old_policy shares parameters with your current model (or was not frozen), then:

🔥 The loss would propagate gradients into the old_values computation.

Even though you're optimizing current_value_net, PyTorch will try to compute gradients of with respect to everything in the computation graph — including V_\text{old}(s_t).
